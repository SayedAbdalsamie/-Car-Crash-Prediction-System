# Car Crash or Collision Prediction System Using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a computer vision system designed to predict car crashes or collisions using advanced machine-learning techniques. By leveraging a pre-trained VGG16 model, the system analyzes traffic-related video footage and images to enhance road safety.

## Objectives
- Create a robust computer vision system for predicting car crashes.
- Fine-tune the pre-trained VGG16 model using transfer learning with additional training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and F1 score metrics.
- Present findings and recommendations for future work.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing of video footage and images.
- Model development using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Performance validation using a confusion matrix and other relevant metrics.
- Presentation of the model on a web platform for enhanced accessibility and demonstration.




## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV
- **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the web presentation)
